# Hello Samples

These samples show basic workflow and activity features.

To run, first see [README.md](../README.md) for prerequisites. Then, run the following from this directory to run the
`hello_activity.py` sample:

    uv run hello_activity.py

The result will be:

    Result: Hello, World!

Replace `hello_activity.py` in the command with any other example filename to run it instead.
