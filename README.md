# Temporal Python SDK Samples

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

The Python SDK is under development. There are no compatibility guarantees nor proper documentation pages at this time.

## Usage

Prerequisites:

* Python >= 3.7
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

With this repository cloned, run the following at the root of the directory:

    poetry install --no-root

That loads all dependencies. Then to run a sample, usually you just run it in Python:

    poetry run python script_name.py

See each sample's directory for specific instructions.

## Samples

* [Activity Worker](activity_worker) - Use Python activities from a workflow in another language
