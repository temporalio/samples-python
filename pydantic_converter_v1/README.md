# Pydantic v1 Converter Sample

**This sample shows how to use Pydantic v1 with Temporal. This is not recommended: use Pydantic v2 if possible, and use the
main [pydantic_converter](../pydantic_converter/README.md) sample.**

To install, run:

    uv sync --group pydantic-converter
    uv run pip uninstall pydantic pydantic-core
    uv run pip install pydantic==1.10

To run, first see the root [README.md](../README.md) for prerequisites. Then, run the following from this directory to start the
worker:

    uv run worker.py

This will start the worker. Then, in another terminal, run the following to execute the workflow:

    uv run starter.py

In the worker terminal, the workflow and its activity will log that it received the Pydantic models. In the starter
terminal, the Pydantic models in the workflow result will be logged.

### Notes

This sample also demonstrates use of `datetime` inside of Pydantic v1 models. Due to a known issue with the Temporal
sandbox, this class is seen by Pydantic v1 as `date` instead of `datetime` upon deserialization. This is due to a
[known Python issue](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89010) where, when we proxy the `datetime` class in the
sandbox to prevent non-deterministic calls like `now()`, `issubclass` fails for the proxy type causing Pydantic v1 to think
it's a `date` instead. In `worker.py`, we have shown a workaround of disabling restrictions on `datetime` which solves
this issue but no longer protects against workflow developers making non-deterministic calls in that module.
