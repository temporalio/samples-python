"""Sliding Window Batch Processing Sample.

This sample demonstrates a batch processing workflow that maintains a sliding window
of record processing workflows. It includes:

- ProcessBatchWorkflow: Main workflow that partitions work across multiple sliding windows
- SlidingWindowWorkflow: Implements the sliding window pattern with continue-as-new
- RecordProcessorWorkflow: Processes individual records
- RecordLoader: Activity for loading records from external sources
