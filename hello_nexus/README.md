# Nexus

Temporal Nexus is a feature of the Temporal platform designed to connect durable executions across team, namespace,
region, and cloud boundaries. It promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your teamâ€™s capabilities
via well-defined service API contracts for other teams to use. These can abstract underlying Temporal primitives such as
Workflows, or execute arbitrary code.
