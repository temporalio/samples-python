# Waiting for message handlers, and performing compensation and cleanup in message handlers

This sample demonstrates the following recommended practices:

1. Ensuring that all signal and update handlers are finished before a successful
    workflow return, and on workflow failure, cancellation, and continue-as-new.
2. Performing necessary compensation/cleanup in an update handler when the
    workflow is cancelled, fails, or continues-as-new.


To run, open two terminals and `cd` to this directory in them.

Run the worker in one terminal:

    poetry run python worker.py

And run the workflow-starter code in the other terminal:

    poetry run python starter.py


Here's the output you'll see, along with some explanation:

```
workflow exit type: success
  update action on premature workflow exit: continue
    游녢 [Caller gets a successful update response because main workflow method waits for handlers to finish]
    游릭 caller received update result
    游릭 caller received workflow result
  update action on premature workflow exit: abort_with_compensation
    游녢 [Same as above: the workflow is successful for action-on-premature exit is irrelevant]
    游릭 caller received update result
    游릭 caller received workflow result


workflow exit type: failure
  update action on premature workflow exit: continue
    游녢 [update does not abort and main workflow method waits for handlers to finish => caller gets successful update result prior to workflow failure]

    游댮 caught exception while waiting for workflow result: Workflow execution failed: deliberately failing workflow
  update action on premature workflow exit: abort_with_compensation
    游녢 [update aborts, compensates and raises => caller gets failed update result]
