# Financial Research Agent

Multi-agent financial research system with specialized roles, extended with Temporal's durable execution.

*Adapted from [OpenAI Agents SDK financial research agent](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/financial_research_agent)*

## Architecture

This example shows how you might compose a richer financial research agent using the Agents SDK. The pattern is similar to the `research_bot` example, but with more specialized sub-agents and a verification step.

The flow is:

1. **Planning**: A planner agent turns the end user's request into a list of search terms relevant to financial analysis â€“ recent news, earnings calls, corporate filings, industry commentary, etc.
2. **Search**: A search agent uses the built-in `WebSearchTool` to retrieve terse summaries for each search term. (You could also add `FileSearchTool` if you have indexed PDFs or 10-Ks.)
3. **Sub-analysts**: Additional agents (e.g. a fundamentals analyst and a risk analyst) are exposed as tools so the writer can call them inline and incorporate their outputs.
4. **Writing**: A senior writer agent brings together the search snippets and any sub-analyst summaries into a long-form markdown report plus a short executive summary.
5. **Verification**: A final verifier agent audits the report for obvious inconsistencies or missing sourcing.

## Running the Example

First, start the worker:
```bash
uv run openai_agents/financial_research_agent/run_worker.py
```

Then run the financial research workflow:
```bash
uv run openai_agents/financial_research_agent/run_financial_research_workflow.py
```

Enter a query like:
```
Write up an analysis of Apple Inc.'s most recent quarter.
```

You can also just hit enter to run this query, which is provided as the default.

## Components

### Agents

- **Planner Agent**: Creates a search plan with 5-15 relevant search terms
- **Search Agent**: Uses web search to gather financial information
- **Financials Agent**: Analyzes company fundamentals (revenue, profit, margins)
- **Risk Agent**: Identifies potential red flags and risk factors
- **Writer Agent**: Synthesizes information into a comprehensive report
- **Verifier Agent**: Audits the final report for consistency and accuracy

### Writer Agent Tools

The writer agent has access to tools that invoke the specialist analysts:
- `fundamentals_analysis`: Get financial performance analysis
- `risk_analysis`: Get risk factor assessment

## Temporal Integration

The example demonstrates several Temporal patterns:
- Durable execution of multi-step research workflows
- Parallel execution of web searches using `asyncio.create_task`
- Use of `workflow.as_completed` for handling concurrent tasks
- Proper import handling with `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()`
