        - On successful workflow return
        - On workflow cancellation
        - On workflow failure

        Your workflow can also exit via Continue-As-New. In that case you would usually wait for
        the handlers to finish immediately before the call to continue_as_new(); that's not
        illustrated in this sample.

        If you additionally need to perform cleanup or compensation on workflow failure or
        cancellation, see the message_passing/waiting_for_handlers_and_compensation sample.
