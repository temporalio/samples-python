# Temporal Python SDK Samples

This is the set of Python samples for the [Python SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python).

## Usage

Prerequisites:

* Python >= 3.8
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
* [Local Temporal server running](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations#run-a-development-cluster)

With this repository cloned, run the following at the root of the directory:

    poetry install

That loads all required dependencies. Then to run a sample, usually you just run it in Python. For example:

    poetry run python hello/hello_activity.py

Some examples require extra dependencies. See each sample's directory for specific instructions.

## Samples

  * [hello_cron](hello/hello_cron.py) - Execute a workflow once a minute.
  * [hello_exception](hello/hello_exception.py) - Execute an activity that raises an error out of the workflow and out
    of the program.
  * [hello_local_activity](hello/hello_local_activity.py) - Execute a local activity from a workflow.
  * [hello_mtls](hello/hello_mtls.py) - Accept URL, namespace, and certificate info as CLI args and use mTLS for
    connecting to server.
  * [hello_parallel_activity](hello/hello_parallel_activity.py) - Execute multiple activities at once.
  * [hello_query](hello/hello_query.py) - Invoke queries on a workflow.
  * [hello_search_attributes](hello/hello_search_attributes.py) - Start workflow with search attributes then change
    while running.
  * [hello_signal](hello/hello_signal.py) - Send signals to a workflow.
<!-- Keep this list in alphabetical order -->

## Test

Running the tests requires `poe` to be installed.

    python -m pip install poethepoet

Once you have `poe` installed you can run:

    poe test
