# MCP + Temporal Integration Research Findings

## Summary

This research project explored two approaches for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Temporal workflows:

1. **Minimal Client Approach** âœ… (Working)
2. **Transport-Based Approach** ðŸš§ (Partially Working)

## Key Discoveries

### 1. anyio Compatibility with Temporal

**Initial Hypothesis**: anyio/sniffio would be incompatible with Temporal's custom event loop.

**Finding**: anyio actually works fine in Temporal workflows! The issue was more subtle:
- Temporal's `_WorkflowInstanceImpl` event loop has a `get_task_factory()` method
- However, it raises `NotImplementedError` instead of returning `None`
- anyio expects `None` when no custom task factory is set
- Solution: Patch the method to catch `NotImplementedError` and return `None`

### 2. Event Loop Patching

```python
def patch_temporal_event_loop():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    original_get_task_factory = loop.get_task_factory
    
    def patched_get_task_factory():
        try:
            return original_get_task_factory()
        except NotImplementedError:
            return None  # What anyio expects
    
    loop.get_task_factory = patched_get_task_factory
```

### 3. Working Approaches

#### Minimal Client (NexusMCPClientSession)
- Bypasses MCP SDK's `ClientSession` entirely
- Directly translates MCP operations to Nexus calls
- Simple, reliable, and working
- Best for production use

#### Transport-Based (Experimental)
- Uses the real MCP `ClientSession` with custom transport
- More complex due to async message routing
- Currently faces challenges with bidirectional stream coordination
- Demonstrates that anyio CAN work in Temporal with proper patching

## Architecture Insights

### Session Management
- MCP sessions map naturally to Temporal workflow instances
- The `initialize()` call should start the workflow session
- Each session maintains stateful context (thoughts, branches)

### Nexus as Transport
- Nexus operations provide request-response semantics
- Challenge: MCP ClientSession expects bidirectional streams
- Solution: Queue-based adapters or direct operation mapping

```

## Recommendations

1. **For Production**: Use the minimal client approach
   - Simpler, more reliable
   - Avoids complex async stream coordination
   - Still provides full MCP functionality

2. **For SDK Improvement**: Add proper `get_task_factory` stub to Temporal Python SDK
   - Would enable broader ecosystem compatibility
   - Simple fix: return `None` instead of raising `NotImplementedError`

3. **For MCP SDK**: Consider providing a simpler client interface
   - Not all transports need bidirectional streaming
   - Request-response pattern is common and simpler

## Next Steps

1. Polish the minimal client implementation
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Create more complex MCP tool examples
4. Consider contributing the event loop patch to Temporal SDK
5. Document the pattern for others to follow

## Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrated that MCP can be integrated with Temporal workflows. The minimal client approach provides a clean, working solution, while the transport-based approach revealed important insights about anyio compatibility and the challenges of adapting streaming protocols to request-response patterns.
