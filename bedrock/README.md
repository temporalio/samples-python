* [entity](entity) - Full multi-Turn chat using an entity workflow..

## Pre-requisites

1. An AWS account with Bedrock enabled.
2. A machine that has access to Bedrock.
3. A local Temporal server running on the same machine. See [Temporal's dev server docs](https://docs.temporal.io/cli#start-dev-server) for more information.

These examples use Amazon's Python SDK (Boto3). To configure Boto3 to use your AWS credentials, follow the instructions in [the Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html).

## Running the samples

For these sample, the optional `bedrock` dependency group must be included. To include, run:

    poetry install --with bedrock

There are 3 Bedrock samples, see the README.md in each sub-directory for instructions on running each.
